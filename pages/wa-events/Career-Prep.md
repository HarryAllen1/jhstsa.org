Career Prep is currently a middle school national TSA event. Washington TSA will run Career Prep as a high school event also. Students have to research an entry-level career, and write a cover letter and resume as if they have just graduated from college/high school/tech school with whatever training is required for the position they are applying for. Then, semifinalists will do an interview as well. This is one of the most useful skills TSA students will use for a lifetime.

This event incorporates elements of leadership, career research, resume development and interview skills in a real-world application.
