# Silent Film (Washington Only)

::: info
This is a Washington Only event. Washington Only events typically have smaller competition. However, you won't be able to compete in this event at the national level.
:::

Participants use video production skills to create a “silent” movie and a musical score to accompany the film. Silent films encourage students to think about music and its application to other forms of art and technology.

NOTE: Silent film means NO spoken words that can be heard. People can be talking in your film, but should never be heard.
