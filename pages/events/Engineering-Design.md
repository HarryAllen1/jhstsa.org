# Engineering Design

Participants develop a solution to an annual theme that is
based on a specific challenge noted by the National Academy
of Engineering (NAE) in its compilation of the grand challenges
for engineering in the 21st century. The solution will include a
documentation portfolio, a display, and a model/prototype.
Semifinalists deliver a presentation and participate in an
interview.
