# Board Game Design

::: warning Washington-specific modification
Board Game Design will be an early entry event.
:::

Participants develop, build, and package a board game that focuses on a subject of their choice. Creative packaging, and the instructions, pieces, and cards associated with the pilot game will be evaluated. Semifinalists set up the game, demonstrate how the game is played, explain the gameâ€™s features, and discuss the design process.
