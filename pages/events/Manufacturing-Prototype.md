# Manufacturing Prototype

Participants design, fabricate, and use Computer Integrated
Manufacturing (CIM) to create a product that addresses the
annual theme. A documentation portfolio and the completed
product prototype are submitted for evaluation. Semifinalists
give a product “sales pitch” and demonstration.
