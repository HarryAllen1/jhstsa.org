# Senior Solar Sprint

The Senior Solar Sprint (SSS) competition is managed by TSA.
Students apply scientific understanding, creativity, experimentation, and teamwork to design, build, and race a model solar
vehicle that carries a payload; documentation of the process
is required. Students must register on Cvent to participate and
begin the SSS journey (ask Mr. Shelton to do this for you).
