# Biotechnology Design

Participants select a contemporary biotechnology problem
that addresses the annual theme and demonstrates understanding of the topic through documented research, the
development of a solution, a display (including an optional
model or prototype), and an effective multimedia presentation. Semifinalists deliver a presentation and participate in an
interview.
