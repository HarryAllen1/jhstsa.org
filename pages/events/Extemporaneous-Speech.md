# Extemporaneous Speech

Participants select a technology-related or TSA topic from among three topic cards and prepare and give a three-to-five-minute speech that communicates their knowledge of the chosen topic. The quality of the speech determines advancement to the semifinalist level of competition, for which an identical competition procedure is followed to determine finalists.

## Pre-conference Submission Requirements

### January 23rd

(TBD)

Select one of the three topics. Take 15 minutes to write notes, and then video your speech, upload it to the platform of your choice, and submit the URL link.

DO NOT use outside resources for research. DO NOT take more than 15 minutes for notes, and DO NOT record several versions of your speech. The point is to simulate the challenge time constraints you will be facing in March.
