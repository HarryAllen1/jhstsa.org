# Virtual Reality Visualization (VR)

Participants use video and 3D computer graphics tools and
design processes to create a two-to-three-minute VR visualization (accompanied by supporting documentation) that
addresses the annual theme. Semifinalists deliver a presentation about their visualization and participate in an interview.
