# Fashion Design and Technology

::: warning Washington-specific modification
All entries (whether they make semifinals or not) will participate in a runway show on Thursday evening at State.

ALL teams should write up a paragraph about their design, including student names and roles on the team, that will be read while they are modeling
:::

To address the annual theme, participants demonstrate
expertise in fashion design principles by creating a wearable
garment, garment patterns, and a documentation portfolio.
Semifinalist teams present their garment designs (worn by
team models), discuss the design process with evaluators, and
respond to interview questions.
