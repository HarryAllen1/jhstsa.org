# Promotional Design

Participants use computerized graphic communications layout
and design skills to produce a promotional resource packet.
The resource must address the annual theme/problem and
include at least four printed publication items and required
documentation. Semifinalists demonstrate publishing competency in an onsite technical design challenge.
