# Architectural Design

::: warning Washington-specific modification
This event will _not_ be early entry.
:::

In response to the annual design challenge, participants
develop a set of architectural plans and related materials, and
construct both a physical and computer-generated model to
accurately depict their design. Semifinalists deliver a presentation and participate in an interview
