To address the annual theme, participants demonstrate expertise in fashion design principles by creating a wearable garment, garment patterns, and a documentation portfolio. Semifinalist teams present their garment designs (worn by team models), discuss the design process with evaluators, and respond to interview questions.

Teams will submit one (1) or two (2) garments for judging (top and bottom or one \[1\]-piece.) All required components must fit inside a 32-quart plastic container. Any accessories (hats, gloves, boots, etc.) may be used during semifinalist presentations, however, they are not submitted in the preliminary round.
