# Extemporaneous Speech

Participants select a technology-related or TSA topic from
among three topic cards and prepare and give a three-to-five-minute speech that communicates their knowledge of the
chosen topic. The quality of the speech determines advancement to the semifinalist level of competition, for which an
identical competition procedure is followed to determine
