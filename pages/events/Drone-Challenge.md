# Drone Challenge (UAV)

::: warning Washington-specific modifications

1. As a safety guideline, all drone teams will need to provide a plastic container with a lid to house their drone. We will use these containers to prevent teams from having to remove the drone propellers so many times. However, the team will still have to demonstrate that their props are removable. This is a Go/No Go requirement. Not having the container will result in disqualification.
2. Teams will have 15 minutes in the prep/practice area, rather than 30.

:::

Participants design, build, assemble, document, and test fly an open-source Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV) according to the stated annual theme/problem specifications. The required documentation portfolio must include elements such as a photographic log, wiring schematics, and a description of the programming software used. Semifinalists participate in an interview.
