# Senior Solar Sprint

The Senior Solar Sprint (SSS) competition is managed by TSA. Students apply scientific understanding, creativity, experimentation, and teamwork to design, build, and race a model solar vehicle that carries a payload; documentation of the process is required. Students must register via an Army Educational Outreach Program (AEOP) portal to participate and begin the SSS journey (ask Mr. Shelton to do this for you if you are interested).
