# Transportation Modeling

Participants research, design, and produce a scale model
of a vehicle that complies with the annual design problem.
A display for the model and a documentation portfolio –
containing elements such as a description of the vehicle,
photographs and commentary detailing the vehicle production, and technical illustrations – are required. Semifinalists
participate in an interview.
