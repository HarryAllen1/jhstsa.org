# Music Production

Participants produce an original musical piece designed to be played during the closing session of the national TSA conference. The quality of the musical piece and required documentation (including elements such as a plan of work, self-evaluation, and a list of hardware, software, and instruments used) determines advancement to the semifinal level of competition, during which semifinalist participants are interviewed.

## Theme

Create a musical piece that will be used as the background music for a role-playing game (RPG) video game. It will be played during the parts of the game when the player’s character is visiting the blacksmith.

## Pre-conference Submission Requirements

### January 23rd

Students will upload their musical file to any platform, and then submit a URL link to their musical piece.

**Note**: A lot of what gets submitted is random computer generated sound, not music. It is neither energizing nor interesting.

Before creating/submitting your musical piece, ask yourself these questions:

- Is this just an electronic sound that doesn’t go anywhere?
- If this music was played just before the Awards Session started, would it energize students, or would they ignore it as background sound?
- Could this music be used for an exciting part of the soundtrack for an action movie?
- Are the judges going to listen all the way through, or turn it off after 15 seconds and submit their scores?

### March 14th

Students will submit final portfolio and link to music.
