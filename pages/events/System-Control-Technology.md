# System Control Technology

Participants develop a solution to a problem (typically one
from an industrial setting) presented onsite at the conference. They analyze the problem, build a computer-controlled
mechanical model, program the model, demonstrate the
programming and mechanical features of the model-solution
in an interview, and provide instructions for evaluators to
operate the model.
