# Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Architecture

::: warning
Participants may participate in CAD Architecture or CAD Engineering, but not both.
:::

Participants use complex computer graphic skills, tools, and processes to respond to a design challenge in which they develop representations of architectural subjects, such as foundation and/or floor plans, and/or elevation drawings, and/or details of architectural ornamentation or cabinetry. The solution to the design challenge and participant answers in an interview are evaluated.
