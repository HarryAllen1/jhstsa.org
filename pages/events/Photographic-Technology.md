# Photographic Technology

Participants produce a photographic portfolio - demonstrating
expertise in photo and imaging technology processes - to
convey a message based on the annual theme. Semifinalists
have 24 hours to complete a portfolio of photos (with required
documentation) taken onsite at the national TSA conference.
Finalists are determined based on the quality of the semifinal
portfolio, the portfolio presentation, and interview responses.
