# Early Entry Submission Deadline

Select events have an early entry deadline on 14 March 2025 at 5:00 PM. These entries will all be submitted on [Judge Pro](https://judgepro.registermychapter.com/org/jpwa-tsastate/conf/jpwa-tsastate/student). Make sure you check the Washington TSA site to ensure you are submitting the correct items.

The 5:00 PM deadline is a hard limit. If you are in the middle of uploading a file when 5:00 PM is reached, your upload will be canceled and you will likely be disqualified from that event.
