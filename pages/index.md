## National event vs. Washington only event

National events are curated by National TSA. Washington only events are curated by Washington TSA and can only be competed in during the State conference.

These events operate in mostly the same way. However, National events are typically more popular, and are therefore more competitive. If you want to compete in the National conference, you must place in the top 3\* in a National event.

\*Exceptions are [Fashion Design and Technology](./events/Fashion-Design-and+Technology.md) and [Video Game Design](./events/Video-Game-Design.md). For these events, you only have to place in the top 5.
