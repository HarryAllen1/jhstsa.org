AI is completely banned in all TSA submissions. Here is TSA's Honor Statement:

> All work must be created and completed by individual competitors or teams. Plagiarism, the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) software, copyright violation, cheating, and falsification of information are prohibited. Participants may NOT use any generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, etc.). Any attempt to gain an unfair advantage will not be tolerated. Competitors at any level of TSA competition understand and agree to abide by the TSA Honor Statement.
>
> If it is determined that a student violated the TSA Honor Statement, a rules violation of twenty percent (20%) will be incurred.

## National event vs. Washington only event

National events are curated by National TSA. Washington only events are curated by Washington TSA and can only be competed in during the State conference.

These events operate in mostly the same way. However, National events are typically more popular, and are therefore more competitive. If you want to compete in the National conference, you must place in the top 3\* in a National event.

\*Exceptions are [Fashion Design and Technology](./events/Fashion-Design-and-Technology.md) and [Video Game Design](./events/Video-Game-Design.md). For these events, you only have to place in the top 5.
